# Elastic-on-LKE
Terraform scripts to deploy Elastic and Kibana on LKE(Linode Kubernetes Engine). 

Just set your Linode API token as an environment var via ```export TF_VAR_token="xxxx"```, modify some vars in terraform.tfvars  and off you go.

These TF files will create a LKE cluster and will use Helm to install all the required software packages. It will use NGINX as the ingress controller and all certificates will be automaticall created using cert-manager.

By default an "elastic" user will be created used for both elastic and kibana with a random password. Password can be retrieved via a ```terraform output -json```.
